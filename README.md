## AXA-O-AYA

The Shaman gave me a drink and now I'm orbiting around a murderous planet, struggling to death.

### Run the game

The game works with a NodeJS server for file delivery, and ThreeJS on client side.

Running the game for linux:
```markdown
cd src/
npm install
./run.sh
```

You just have to run the 'npm install' command in the src/ folder in order to install dependencies, then execute the run.(sh/bat) script to launch the server. If you have no error, you can use your browser and go to http://localhost:8080/ to be amazed.

### How to play

There are 4 players on the screen, each of them have a set of keys to control the space ship and shooting:
 - Player 1: ZQSD & Alt
 - Player 2: OKLM & Space
 - Player 3: Arrows & Ctrl
 - Player 4: Mouse Movement & Mouse Click
